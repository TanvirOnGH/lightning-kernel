## About

Experimental linux kernel with custom patches applied from various sources, designed to be high performant.

## Warning

This is based on linux kernel version [6.3.13](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/?h=v6.3.13) (EOL). This release is stable and is End-of-Life with last update on 2023-07-11.

## Linux kernel

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
